**Built by:** Me, revolutionizing farming through intelligent automation  
**Hackathon:** AI & Automation Unpacked - June 2025  
**Stack:** IBM Granite AI, React, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB

## 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Agriculture forms the backbone of global food security and livelihoods — yet it remains one of the most under-digitized and vulnerable sectors. 

### **Critical Agricultural Crisis**
- **600 million farmers worldwide** struggle with outdated farming methods
**Up to 40% of global crop production is lost every year** to pests, diseases, and poor management — costing over **US$220 billion annually** ([FAO, 2022](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/agriculture/at-least-40-global-crops-lost-to-pests-every-year-fao-77252)), ([FAO, 2022](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/Climate-change-fans-spread-of-pests-and-threatens-plants-and-crops-new-FAO-study/zh)).
- **80% of smallholder farmers lack access** to modern technology, financing, and expert guidance ([World Bank, 2020](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/851711521095180329/pdf/124304-WP-PUBLIC-AgriBookMar.pdf)).
- **Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme climate events** routinely damage harvests, disrupt yields, and ruin livelihoods ([IPCC, 2023](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf)).
- **The import value in Agriculture market is projected to amount to US$939.5bn in 2025.** ([Statista, 2024](https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/agriculture/worldwide)), yet yields remain **30-70% below potential** in developing economies ([PMC, NCBI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10896731/)).
- Despite government subsidies and rural programs, **most farmers cannot navigate complex schemes** or access credit efficiently — contributing to cyclical poverty and food insecurity ([IMF](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/068/2024/002/article-A001-en.xml)).

### **Market Pain Points**
- **No real-time AI-powered decision support** for farmers when pest attacks, soil issues, or climate risks strike  
- **Knowledge gaps result in 40-60% reduced yields**, undercutting profitability and national food security  

- **Unpredictable weather patterns** destroying harvests without warning
- **Credit access challenges** preventing farming modernization

### **Opportunity Identified**
**Transform agriculture through IBM Granite AI** - delivering instant, intelligent farming decisions that **increase yields by 40%**, **reduce losses by 60%**, and **empower every farmer globally**.
